# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis-PYTHON
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. They want to uncover more information about their sales patterns by performing initial exploratory data analysis using PYTHON.
## Objectives
To perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Instacart's data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
##### Clean and merge four data sets: orders, products, department, and customer data.
##### Analyze the data to answer questions from marketing and sales teams (for example, the busiest time of day, highest grossing days of the week, most loyal customers, popular products, etc.).
##### Analyze the data to discover differences in user's ordering habits based on various characteristics (such as region, income, age, loyalty status, etc.).
##### Create customer profiles based on combinations of variables and analyze how their ordering behaviors may differ (for example: gender, dietary choice(vegetarian/vegan), number of dependants, etc.).
## Tools
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy
Software: Jupiter Notebook, Excel
## Skills Demonstrated
### Cleaning data
Removed duplicates, resolved missing values, and addressed mixed or incorrect data types.
### Merging data
Selected and prepared data for merging, confirmed successful merge, and exported the final merge as a pkl file.
### Exploratory analysis
Explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable, also explored using histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts to explore the distributions of data.
### Derived new variables
Grouped data by user, order, and department to allow exploration and analysis at each level; used aggregated data to create flags about user ordering habits (such as ‘new customer’, ‘loyal customer’, etc.) and demographic info (such as 'income group', 'dietary choice’); confirmed the new data created via crosstabs and value counts.
### Visualizing data
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts (vertical/horizontal, stacked, and 100% stacked).
### Reporting result
Provided an Excel file that explained the answers to questions from sales/marketing as well as documented the data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations.
